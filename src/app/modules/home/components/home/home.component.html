    <h1>What is a Conformation Show?</h1>
    <p>Dog shows, or conformation events originated as a way for breeder's to evaluate their breeding stock. Dogs at
      these events compete for points towards their championship. There are 3 types of events in a conformation show, these
      are <strong>All-Breed Shows</strong>, <strong>Specialty Shows</strong>, and <strong>Group Shows</strong>. Dogs are
      evaluated based on how closely they conform to their breed's official standards. The more they conform, the better
      their chances at winning Best in Show!
